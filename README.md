# Web Search Preview Browser Extension

Exploring web search preview, because I think the current state of previews is very underwheling.

The fact that most websites block cross-site requests pretty much makes this so much more underwhelming than it should be...

## Tasks

- [ ] Add `<iframe>` to every result to see if it's performant.
  - The real problem is that most websites don't allow for `<iframe>`s...
  - [ ] Maybe I could extend this to any link on any website, as a popover.
